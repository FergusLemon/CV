I am a junior developer with a passion for building and learning. I am looking to join a team with a focus on building products driven by customers needs, that follow the principles of TDD, clean code and 'You aren't gonna need it' (YAGNI).  In return I offer resourcefulness, clear thinking, a desire to keep learning and to tackle difficult problems to support the team's goals. 

I have over eight years' worth of experience at PwC where I was a number one rated senior manager, I managed teams ranging from 2-20 people working across various sectors and services, from Accounting to Technology Consulting.  In 2016 I completed the Makers Academy coding bootcamp with a view to gaining skills that would help me move into a more technical role at PwC and whilst I achieved that goal there was little to no scope for me to gain experience coding.  Having assessed my options I took the difficult decision to leave PwC and focus my efforts on landing a role as a developer.

**Tech Skills**: Javascript, Typescript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
