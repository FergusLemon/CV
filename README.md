I am a junior developer with a passion for building and learning. I am looking to join a team with a focus on building products driven by their customers needs, that follow the principles of TDD, clean code and YAGNI.  In return I offer dedication, hard work, resourcefulness, desire to keep learning and tackle difficult problems to support the team's overall goals. 

I have over eight year's worth of experience at PwC where I was a number one rated senior manager, I managed teams ranging from 2-20 people working across a range of sectors and services from Accounting to Technology Consulting.  In 2016 I completed the Makers Academy coding bootcamp with a view to gaining skills that would help me move into a more technical role at PwC and whilst I achieved that goal there was little to no scope for me to gain experience coding.  Having assessed my options I took the difficult decision to leave PwC and focus my efforts on coding and here I am.
